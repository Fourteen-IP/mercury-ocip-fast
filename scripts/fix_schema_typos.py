"""
A script to fix common typos in the schema definitions.

Some schemas have incorrect response types in their doc strings, since this is used to generate the docs, we need to fix them here.

This uses "correct_typo", a series of helper functions to run some heuristics. It will:

- Strip Versioning
- Check that the Response actually exists
- If it's not real, it will first check any missing words or moved words and re-arrange them in correct order.
- Typo check all words - e.g., Get instead of Getl
- Find the highest version of the command
- Return the response

This script will then iterate through all dataclasses and run these checks. Updating the final commands.py file.
